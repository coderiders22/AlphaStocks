# Stock Prediction with Sentiment Analysis - README

## Project Overview:
Our project focuses on providing accurate stock predictions by integrating sentiment analysis. We offer a comprehensive solution through three primary components:

### 1. LSTM Model:
Utilizing LSTM models to ensure precise stock predictions.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis of News:
Analyzing current news sentiments to gauge their impact on stock prices.

### 3. Portfolio Guidance for Beginners:
Offering personalized portfolio suggestions based on sentiment analysis and stock progress.

## Detailed Description:

### 1. LSTM Model:
Our project distinguishes itself by employing LSTM models, known for their accuracy in stock prediction. These models analyze historical data and market trends to forecast future stock prices.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis of News:
In addition to traditional stock prediction methods, we incorporate sentiment analysis of news articles. By assessing the sentiment of current news, we provide insights into how public sentiment influences stock prices.

### 3. Portfolio Guidance for Beginners:
We understand that navigating the stock market can be daunting, especially for beginners. Hence, we offer a feature that analyzes stock progress and suggests BUY/SELL options, simplifying portfolio management.

## Why Our Solution?
- **Accuracy**: Our models, coupled with sentiment analysis, ensure precise stock predictions.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: By considering both historical data and current news sentiment, we provide a holistic view of market trends.
- **User-Friendly**: Our platform offers intuitive portfolio guidance, catering to both novice and experienced investors.

## Tech Stack:
- **Models**: LSTM for stock prediction, integrated with Python libraries like TensorFlow.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python libraries like distilroberta-finetuned-financial-news-sentiment-analysis model.
- **Development**: Python for backend development, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend, and Flask for web framework.
